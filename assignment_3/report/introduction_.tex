The broadcast ephemeris for GPS satellites is often used for lower accuracy surveys that can be conducted in real-time by receivers using the C/A or P- codes. Such surveys might include tacheometry surveys or for stake-out assistance. The navigation message contains predicted satellite positions which are transmitted from the satellite in real-time. Satellites tracking data obtained from monitor stations around the world is used by the Master Control Station to compute new parameters for the satellite orbits. These parameters are then transmitted back to the satellites and the navigation message is updated.

The precise ephemeris is post-calculated using a least squares adjustment of the actual tracking data. These are more accurate because they are based on actual tracking data and not predicted data. The precise positions can only be obtained in 14-17 hours in the case of Rapid, or in 13 days for the final orbit.

In this report, a broadcast ephemeris will be calculated using a broadcast ephemeris algorithm, this will be compared to the precise ephemeris over a period of 24 hours. The purpose is to investigate the reliability over time of a single navigation messages satellite positions.
