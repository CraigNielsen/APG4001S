\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute ECF cartesian coordinates of the satellite every 15 minsutes using the broadcast ephemeris algorithm.
	\item read in IGS precise ephemeris file for week 1854 for the satellite position.
	\item Compute the radial vector for both.
	\item Plot differences at each epoch and ascertain the interval for which the broadcast ephemeris is most accurate with respect to precise ephemeris.
	\item display the RMS of the radial differences.
\end{itemize}
